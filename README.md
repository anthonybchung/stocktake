# Stocktake

## Project Vision

I want to build a web application that will help me reduce the repetitive process in stocktaking.

- Download StockTake data(MS Excel format) from POS system.
- Modify the table to make it visual appleasing to make stock take easier during tallying.
- Print out the MS Excel spread sheet.
- During stock count
  - Read item label.
  - Search for the item name on the form.
  - Tally the item.
- At the end of the stocktake, we add all the tally and search for any discrepancies.
- If there are any, then we need to retally the items that have discrepancies.

I would like to automate most of these steps.

- Download StockTake data
- Upload to the Web App
- Start scanning the product.
- After all the products are scanned, the web app will create a table and highlight any discrepancies.
- After all is finalised, I want to print the table on A4 paper.
